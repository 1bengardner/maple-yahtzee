A MapleStory themed Yahtzee game

## Getting started

Download all files, then run _Yahtzee.py_.

## How to play

Click `ROLL` to begin. Your five "dice" will be displayed in the middle row.

* Snails are worth 1
* Shrooms are worth 2
* Pigs are worth 3
* Roots are worth 4
* Pandas are worth 5
* Manos are worth 6

For each round, you may `ROLL` up to three times to try to improve your five "dice." During a round, you may `HOLD` "dice" between rolls so they retain their value.

For each round, you must `Select` one of the thirteen options displayed in the top row. The value of each option will vary depending on your final roll.

Your objective is to score as many points as possible.
